# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Network
I designed a network using IP to connect Network A and Network 3. Subnets 1 and 2 were combined into Network A (192.168.1.101) while Network 3 used 192.168.10.1 with a new router. I used subnet masks to separate networks, and NAT/PAT protocols for computer connections, focusing on RIP and static routing over DHCP.
